``` r
# load the library
library(MODISTools)

# download data
subset <- mt_subset(product = "MOD11A2",
                    lat = 40,
                    lon = -110,
                    band = "LST_Day_1km",
                    start = "2004-01-01",
                    end = "2004-02-01",
                    km_lr = 1,
                    km_ab = 1,
                    site_name = "testsite",
                    internal = TRUE,
                    progress = FALSE)
print(str(subset))
```

The output format is a *tidy* data frame, as shown above. When witten to
a csv with the parameter `internal = FALSE` this will result in a flat
file on disk.

Note that when a a region is defined using km_lr and km_ab multiple
pixels might be returned. These are indexed using the `pixel` column in
the data frame containing the time series data. The remote sensing
values are listed in the `value` column. When no band is specified all
bands of a given product are returned, be mindful of the fact that
different bands might require different multipliers to represent their
true values. To list all available products, bands for particular
products and temporal coverage see function descriptions below.

### Batch downloading MODIS time series

When a large selection of locations is needed you might benefit from
using the batch download function `mt_batch_subset()`, which provides a
wrapper around the `mt_subset()` function in order to speed up large
download batches. This function has a similar syntax to `mt_subset()`
but requires a data frame defining site names (site_name) and locations
(lat / lon) (or a comma delimited file with the same structure) to
specify a list of download locations.

Below an example is provided on how to batch download data for a data
frame of given site names and locations (lat / lon).

``` r
# create data frame with a site_name, lat and lon column
# holding the respective names of sites and their location
df <- data.frame("site_name" = paste("test",1:2))
df$lat <- 40
df$lon <- -110
  
# test batch download
subsets <- mt_batch_subset(df = df,
                     product = "MOD11A2",
                     band = "LST_Day_1km",
                     internal = TRUE,
                     start = "2004-01-01",
                     end = "2004-02-01")

print(str(subsets))
```

### Listing products

To list all available products use the mt_products() function.

``` r
products <- mt_products()
head(products)
```

### Listing bands

To list all available bands for a given product use the mt_bands()
function.

``` r
bands <- mt_bands(product = "MOD11A2")
head(bands)
```

### listing dates

To list all available dates (temporal coverage) for a given product and
location use the mt_dates() function.

``` r
dates <- mt_dates(product = "MOD11A2", lat = 42, lon = -110)
head(dates)
```
